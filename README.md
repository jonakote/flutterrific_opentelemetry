# Flutterrific OpenTelemetry

An OpenTelemetry SDK for Flutter applications built on the [Dartastic OpenTelemetry SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry) .

## Why OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is the second most active Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, after Kubernetes. Why?
The OTel standard future-proofs observability.  OpenTelemetry libraries are available for dozens of languages and platforms, and now,
for Dart and Flutter.  

## Why Flutterrific OTel?

Flutterrific OTel applies the [Dartastic OpenTelemetry SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry) 
to easily add powerful observability to Flutter apps.

## Getting Started

### 1. Add dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutterrific_opentelemetry: ^1.0.0
```

### 2. Initialize OpenTelemetry in your app

The simplest robust setup that catches errors and auto-traces the app lifecycle and navigation is as follows.  
See "Correlating Auto-Tracing" below for a more robust version.  Also see [Wonderous Dartastic](https://pub.dev/packages/wonderous_dartastic) for a 
complete example.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutterrific_opentelemetry/flutterrific_otel.dart';

void main() {
  // Catch errors from the Flutter framework.
  FlutterError.onError = (FlutterErrorDetails details) {
    FlutterOTel.reportError('FlutterError.onError', details.exception, details.stack);
    // Optionally, you can also print the error to the console:
    if (kDebugMode) {
      FlutterError.dumpErrorToConsole(details);
    }
  };

  
  // Catch asynchronous errors.
  runZonedGuarded(() {
    FlutterOTel.initialize(
      serviceName: 'my-wonderful-app',
      serviceVersion: '2.0',
      //configures the default trace, consider making other tracers for isolates, etc.
      tracerName: 'ui',
      //OTel standard tenant_id, required for Dartastic.io
      tenantId: 'valued-customer-id',
      //required for the Dartastic.io backend
      dartasticAPIKey: '123456',
      resourceAttributes: {
        // Always consult the OTel Semantic Conventions to find an existing
        // convention name for an attribute.  Semantics are evolving.
        // https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/
        //--dart-define environment=dev
        //See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/deployment-environment/
        DeploymentSemantics.deploymentEnvironmentName.key : String.fromEnvironment('environment'),
        //--dart-define pod-name=powerful-dart-pod
        //See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#kubernetes
        DeploymentSemantics.k8sPodName.key: String.fromEnvironment('pod-name'),
      }
    );
    runApp(MyApp());
  }, (error, stack) {
    if (kDebugMode) {
      debugPrint('$error');
      debugPrintStack(stackTrace: stack, label: 'Flutter app runZoneGuarded');
    }
    FlutterOTel.reportError('Error caught in run', error, stack,
            attributes: {
              'error.source': 'zone_error',
              'error.type': error.runtimeType.toString(),
    });
  });
}

/// When using GoRouter, wrap your _handleRedirect with an OTelGoRouterRedirect
final appRouter = GoRouter(
redirect:  OTelGoRouterRedirect(_handleRedirect).callRedirect,
  routes: [/* routes */]
);
```

That's it! Your app now automatically traces:
- Route transitions
- App lifecycle events (foreground/background)
- With metrics:
  - web vitals
  - apdex 
  - paint times
  - page transitions

With some code you can add:
- spans for clicks, swipes, taps, etc.
- custom spans
- metrics on any widget
- custom metrics

## Default Ports and Endpoints

- OTLP/gRPC uses port 4317 (used for native platforms)
- OTLP/HTTP uses port 4318 (used for web platforms)

## Default Platforms and Protocols
- OTLP/gRPC (port 4317) for native platforms
- OTLP/HTTP/protobuf (port 4318) when`kIsWeb` is true
- Both traces and metrics are supported over both protocols

### Environment Variables

You can configure OpenTelemetry using these standard OTel environment variables:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: Specifies the endpoint URL
  - Example: `--dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=my-otel-collector.com:443`

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`: Specifies the protocol to use
  - default for native platforms: `--dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc`
  - default for Flutter web: `--dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf`

Flutter Web doesn't support gRPC (the default protocol used by OpenTelemetry) due to browser limitations around HTTP/2. 
Instead, for Flutter Web, Flutterrific OTel automatically switches to OTLP over http/protobuf, 
aka OTLP/HTTP, unless specified by the environmental variable.

### Setting Up a Local Collector for Development

For local development, you can use Docker to run a local OpenTelemetry collector:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 --rm -ti grafana/otel-lgtm
```

This runs a Grafana OTel collector that can be accessed at:
- For native apps: `http://localhost:4317` (gRPC)
- For web apps: `http://localhost:4318` (HTTP)


### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, you can:

1. Enable verbose logging by setting `OTelLog.currentLevel = LogLevel.trace`
2. Check for errors in the browser console related to HTTP requests to port 4317/4318
3. Verify your collector is configured to receive OTLP over grpc (4317) HTTP/protobuf (4318)

Common issues:
- CORS errors: Ensure your collector has proper CORS configuration for web browsers
- Connectivity issues: Check that port 4318 is open and accessible
- Protocol mismatch: Verify your collector supports OTLP/HTTP on port 4318

## Technical Limitations

1. **Compression**: Compression is disabled for web platforms due to browser limitations.
2. **Authentication**: For web platforms, authentication must be done via headers rather than gRPC credentials.
3. **Browser Constraints**: Web browsers have limitations on cross-origin requests and HTTP/2 that may affect the reliability of telemetry data collection.

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:
- HTTP/JSON exporter support for even broader web compatibility
- Better metrics support for web applications
- Automatic retries and connection pooling specific to browser environments


## How Auto-Tracing Works

### Auto-Tracing Basics

The root of OpenTelemetry is the `Trace` that holds a tree of `Span`s. A `trace` has a `traceId` this is shared amongst 
all `Span`s in the `Trace`.  Each `Span` has its own `spanId` and a `parentSpanId`.  The first span in a trace is the 
root `Span` and has no `parentSpan` (its parentSpanId is null). All other `Span`s have the `parentSpanId`s of their 
parents, forming a tree of Spans.  

All autotracing occurs in the global default `TracerProvider` and it's default tracer, retrieved from 
`FlutterOTel.tracer`.

### Auto-Traces are Brief

Traces in OTel are not intended to be long-lasting. An anti-pattern is a session trace that lasts for hours or even
weeks and has many child spans. Another is a page span that has child spans for subroutes. The problem with such 
patterns is that spans must `end` and have their parents `end` to get properly ingested by backend observability tools.
Large, multi-hour traces with dozens (or hundreds) of child spans also become unwieldy in APM tools.

Client developers have concerns that server developers don't have worry about - a mobile app can be closed without 
warning with a flick or suspended into the background for week and come back. This is particularly concerning at the 
most important moments.  The user is most likely going to close the app when the app is slow to load, has errors or 
when the user is choosing not to click "Subscribe".  To deal with these pesky users, top-level spans should be created 
frequently and ended immediately.  Keep these issues in mind if you manually manage your own spans.

FlutterOTel starts and ends short-lived spans quickly and `forceFlush()`s the spans to the backend so traces are not
lost when the user closes the app.  This avoids dealing with the cross-platform app lifecycle vagaries.

Instead of long-lasting parent-child relationships, spans are correlated by common attributes, like the traceId, the
deviceId or the userId.

### Correlating Auto-Tracing 

When the app is launched and `FlutterOTel.initialize()` is called, an `app_launch_id` uuid (v4) is created. The 
`app_launch_id` is sent with all spans created with default `UITracer` as an Attribute equal to 
`AppLifecycleSemantics.appLaunchId.key`  to allow tools to correlate all auto-traces from the app's launch until the 
app is closed.  To correlate traces created manually, include 
`{AppLifecycleSemantics.appLaunchId.key : FlutterOTel.appLaunchId}` in span attributes.

To correlate traces for a device across launches, it is recommended to use `device_info_plus` to pass Resource 
Attributes to `FlutterOTel.initialize()`.  To correlate across versions, use `package_info_plus`.  In order to maximize
compatibility, `flutterrific_otel` does not ship with these dependencies.

To correlate across user attributes, use the `commonAttributesFunction` which will be executed to include attributes
on each span.  Unlike Resource attributes, common attribute values change over the course of a launch, for example,
when a user logs in.  Remember that OTel does not allow null Attribute values.

This example is from the `wondrous_otel` example:
```
  ///Flutterrific OTel initialization
  final deviceInfoPlugin = DeviceInfoPlugin();
  final deviceInfo = await deviceInfoPlugin.iosInfo;
  PackageInfo packageInfo = await PackageInfo.fromPlatform();
  
  await FlutterOTel.initialize(
      resourceAttributes: <String, Object>{
        '${EnvironmentResource.deploymentEnvironment}': 'dev',
        DeviceSemantics.deviceId.key : deviceInfo.identifierForVendor ?? 'no_id',
        DeviceSemantics.deviceModel.key : deviceInfo.model,
        DeviceSemantics.devicePlatform.key : deviceInfo.systemName,
        DeviceSemantics.deviceOsVersion.key : deviceInfo.systemVersion,
        DeviceSemantics.deviceModel.key : deviceInfo.isiOSAppOnMac,
        DeviceSemantics.isPhysicalDevice.key : deviceInfo.isPhysicalDevice,
        AppInfoSemantics.appName.key: packageInfo.appName,
        AppInfoSemantics.appPackageName.key: packageInfo.packageName,
        AppInfoSemantics.appVersion.key: packageInfo.version,
        AppInfoSemantics.appBuildNumber.key: packageInfo.buildNumber,
       }.toAttributes(), 
       commonAttributesFunction: () {
            final Map<String, Object> commonAttrs = {};
            if (auth.id != null) {
                commonAttrs[UserSemantics.userId.key] = auth.id;
            }
            if (auth.userRole != null) {
                commonAttrs[UserSemantics.userRole.key] = auth.userRole;
            }
            if (sessionManager.sessionId != null) {
                commonAttrs[UserSemantics.userSession.key] = sessionManager.sessionId;
            }
       }.toAttributes());
```

### Auto-generated Traces

#### Auto tracing errors

```
  // Catch errors from the Flutter framework.
  FlutterError.onError = (FlutterErrorDetails details) {
    // Report the error via your agent.
    FlutterOTel.reportError(details.exception, details.stack);
    // Optionally, you can also print the error to the console:
    // FlutterError.dumpErrorToConsole(details);
  };

  // Catch asynchronous errors.
  runZonedGuarded(() {
    runApp(MyApp());
  }, (error, stack) {
    FlutterOTel.reportError(error, stack);
  });
```

#### Auto tracing the app lifecycle

`FlutterOTel.initialize()` creates an `AppLifecycleObserver` that is added to 
`WidgetsBindingObserver.didChangeAppLifecycleState` to respond to app lifecycle events. 
It sets `FlutterOTel.currentAppLifecycleId` to a new id which is included as `app_lifecycle.id`
(`AppLifecycleSemantics.appLifecycleId`) in all auto-generated spans.

For each change in the app's lifecycle, a span is created and ended that has the current lifecycle state and start time, 
the previous app lifecycle state and duration. The first state is 'active' (not an actual Flutter AppLifecycleState).

For the App lifecycle states detached, inactive, hidden, paused (all except resume), navigation spans are also ended.
(see the next section for navigation spans).

All spans are then flushed to ensure, as best as possible, that all telemetry is sent to the server.

#### Auto tracing navigation

Similar to app lifecycle, Flutterific OTel's NavigatorObserver creates short-lived`Span`s as the user navigates the app. 
For each callback in NavigatorObserver a new navigation span is created for the change. Each spans has information for
the new and previous routes.  The exact semantics are defined in the API's NavigationSemantics.
- NavigationAction routeChangeType (push, pop...)
- New route
  - routeId - similar to a spanId, generated for the new route during the  change
  - name
  - path
  - key
  - arguments
  - startTime
- Previous route 
  - The same information as above, gathered when it was the new route. 
  - routeDuration

#### Auto tracing user interactions


### 3. Add custom tracing

Within these automatic Traces and Spans you can use the
FlutterOTel's [UITracer]'s [startSpan] to start child or
root spans - the tracer will figure out which by assigning a parent
span if it exist or created a new span if there is no root span.  
For more advanced maneuver's you can manually [UITracer]'s [createSpan]  
to create a new span but you  must manage parent and child relationships
manually, and end previous Spans, if appropriate.

For more detailed tracing, you can access the tracer directly:

```dart
import 'package:flutterrific_opentelemetry/flutterrific_otel.dart';

void fetchData() async {
  final tracer = FlutterrificOTel().tracer;
  
  // Start a span
  final span = tracer.startSpan(
    'fetch_user_data',
    attributes: {
      'source': 'api',
      'user_id': '123',
    },
  );
  
  try {
    // Your code here
    await api.fetchUserData();
    span.end(); // End span successfully
  } catch (e, stackTrace) {
    // Record error in span
    span.recordException(e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
    span.setStatus(SpanStatusCode.Error, e.toString());
    span.end(); // End span with error status
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Track User Interactions

```dart
// For individual widgets
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // The interaction will be tracked automatically
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
).withOTelButtonTracking('submit_button');

// For form fields
TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
).withOTelTextFieldTracking('email_field');

// Or manually track interactions
void onTap() {
  FlutterrificOTel().interactionTracker.trackButtonClick(
    context, 
    'custom_button',
  );
}
```

### Error Boundary

Wrap widgets with error boundary to automatically capture render errors:

```dart
MyComplexWidget().withOTelErrorBoundary('profile_screen');
```

## Semantic Conventions

The SDK follows OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for RUM (Real User Monitoring) with attributes like:

- `ui.screen.name` - The name of the current screen/route
- `ui.interaction.type` - The type of interaction (click, scroll, etc.)
- `app.lifecycle.timestamp` - Timestamp for lifecycle events
- `navigation.type` - Type of navigation (push, pop, replace)

## Pluggable (Advanced)

The OTelAPI, OTel Dart SDK and FlutterOTel SDK all use the same factory
pattern that allows the SDK to be extended. You could make your own 
SDK and provide a custom tracer provider or exporter.  Copy the o  
(TODO: Doc an example.)

## FAQ

1. Why can't I use the toAttributes extension on a Map?
This doesn't work because {} the map is not keyed by Strings and allows null (is dynamic):
```
attributes: {
        AppInfoSemantic.appName.key: 'my-cool-app',
      } // .toAttributes() isn't possible
```

Since Attributes cannot have null values per the OTel specification and since the Map is keyed
by String, add types to the Map:
```
attributes: <String, Object>{ //properly typed, no nulls allowed, per spec
        AppInfoSemantic.appName.key: 'my-cool-app',
      }.toAttributes()
```
